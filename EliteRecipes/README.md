# EliteRecipes — Capstone Website

This starter meets your Phase 2 and Phase 3 requirements:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** with responsive layout (Grid/Flex).
- **Interactive planner**: choose up to 3 preferences, generate a 7‑day plan with pictures, and create a consolidated **shopping list** (printable).
- **Showcase sections** for coursework/projects with GitHub links.
- **Contact page** with accessible HTML form and **JavaScript validation**.
- **Deployment-ready** for GitHub Pages.

## File Structure
```
EliteRecipes/
├─ index.html
├─ projects.html
├─ contact.html
├─ styles.css
├─ app.js
└─ assets/   (place any images/logos here)
```

## How to Run Locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools required.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo named **EliteRecipes**.
2. Add these files, commit, and push.
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Branch: main → /(root)** and **Save**.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/EliteRecipes/`

## Where to Insert Your Real Projects
- In **index.html** “Coursework & Projects” and **projects.html**, replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and add more project cards as needed.
- Swap placeholder screenshots with your own images (put them in `/assets`).

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Replace the mock catalog in `app.js` with a real API or local JSON/SQLite served via a tiny backend.
- Add nutrition macros per recipe.
- Add localStorage or Firebase to **save favorite recipes** and export meal plans.
- Add Lighthouse/Performance tweaks (image lazy loading, compression).
